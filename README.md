# Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App

Welcome to the Task Management System project! This application allows users to manage tasks across different boards and statuses, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## Overview

The Task Management System is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes localStorage for data persistence within the browser, allowing users to add, edit, and delete tasks across various boards and statuses.The application is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, with a clean and modern user interface that is responsive to different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks within specific boards and statuses.

- **Dynamic UI**: Real-time updates to the user interface based on user interactions.

- **Data Persistence**: Data is stored locally using localStorage, ensuring tasks are retained between sessions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   [git clone](https://github.com/mariusmokoka/JSL_Portfolio_Piece_BOIMOK510_BCL2401_GroupA_Boikhutso-Mokoka_JSL11.git)
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install Live Server extension to run the project locally.
4. Open index.html with Live Server to start the application.
